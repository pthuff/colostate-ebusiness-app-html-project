                <p><a href="http://curious-george.wikia.com/wiki/Chef_Pisghetti" target="_blank">Chef Pisghetti</a> made his first foray into fine-dining by opening the famous <em>Pisghetti's Italian Restaurant</em>. After 10+ years serving his famous Italian dishes Pisghetti's Restaurant was tragically lost in a fire involving Chef Pisghetti's long-time friend and part-time assistant, <a href="http://curious-george.wikia.com/wiki/George" target="_blank">George</a>. Pisghetti elected to leave Italian fine-dining behind after the loss of his restaurant and begin anew by opening PT Steaks in 2018. Pisghetti had long been fascinated by the idea of creating a fine-dining restaurant focused on exceptional, world-class steaks, and he viewed the loss of his beloved restaurant as an oppurtunity to make his dream a reality.</p>
                <p>Chef Pisghetti is a perfectionist chef who refuses to sell substandard food. He would rather close the restaurant for the day if he is not satisfied with the food that day. He is very good-natured and enjoys having his friends around, especially George, and George enjoys helping him out whenever he can. <a href="http://curious-george.wikia.com/wiki/Ted_Shackleford" target="_blank">The Man with the Yellow Hat</a> is one of his valued customers — he always has a yellow napkin ready for him.</p>
                <p>Chef Pisghetti's wife, <a href="http://curious-george.wikia.com/wiki/Netti" target="_blank">Netti</a>, also works at the restaurant. They have a restaurant cat, <a href="http://curious-george.wikia.com/wiki/Gnocchi" target="_blank">Gnocchi</a>, who is generally allowed to walk around freely, unless Gnocchi is suspected of bad behavior.</p>
